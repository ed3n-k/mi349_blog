    <p>Hey there, this is the index page where you can learn more about me. My name is Eden, I'm a college senior, and I am making this page for my MI 349 class. 
        some of the things I've been up to lately are learning Figma, and getting familar with GitHub. In my spare time, I like to crochet, garden, cook, and hang
    out with my two cats, Teddy and Marigold. In September, I turned 27 years old, and am hoping to finish school in the Spring of 2026!</p>
